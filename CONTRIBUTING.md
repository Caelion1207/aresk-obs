# Contributing to ARESK-OBS

## Project Status: CLOSED

**ARESK-OBS is a frozen instrument.**

This repository represents the final version of ARESK-OBS as an audit instrument for coignitive systems. The project is **closed for development** and does not accept:

- ❌ Pull requests
- ❌ Feature requests
- ❌ Bug reports
- ❌ Code contributions
- ❌ Documentation improvements

---

## Why is the project closed?

ARESK-OBS has reached its intended scope as a measurement instrument. The codebase, documentation, and experimental data (Experiment A-1) represent a complete, auditable artifact for academic study.

Further development would compromise the integrity of the instrument as a reference implementation.

- The theoretical foundations of Ingeniería Coignitiva
- The CAELION framework evaluated in Regime C
